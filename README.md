# So what is Free Code Camp
Free Code Camp's Front End Development program covers an estimated 500 hours of course work that includes HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Query, and Algorithm scripting.  This is broken up with 10 basic, intermediate, and advanced projects. As well as basic algorithms, intermediate algorithms, and advanced algorithms.

This repository is not for an app but more as a journal where I keep a record of everything I have done and learned from FreeCodeCamp.  You will find the code easily on the directories

# WeatherAppFreeCodeCamp
 
Geolocation based weather application, displays weather data based on user's longitudal and latitudinal coordinates.  Also shows weather forecasts for upcoming days. Background image changes based on time of day and weather conditions.  Application is based on my previous mobile weather app however this uses APIUX to get the weather details instead of Open Weather map.
