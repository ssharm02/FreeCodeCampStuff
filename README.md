# So what is Free Code Camp
Free Code Camp's Front End Development program covers an estimated 500 hours of course work that includes HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Query, and Algorithm scripting.  This is broken up with 10 basic, intermediate, and advanced projects. As well as basic algorithms, intermediate algorithms, and advanced algorithms.

This repository is not for an app but more as a journal where I keep a record of everything I have done and learned from FreeCodeCamp.  You will find the code easily on the directories
